There is a growing recognition that mental well-being deserves as much attention as physical health. It’s widely understood that achieving our goals relies on our mental health being **sound**. Many individuals have experienced severe distress due to negative life events, leading them to view life bleakly(阴郁地) and struggle to find purpose.

I myself experienced a prolonged（长期的） period of low spirits when I felt like I was constantly failing at everything, to the point where I considered myself a complete failure. I was trapped in a cycle of negative emotions, overwhelmed by loneliness, helplessness, and a lack of confidence. Eventually, I realized that I needed to take action to improve my situation. I opened up to my parents about my struggles, and their warm support was incredibly beneficial to me. Moreover, I made a conscious effort to revise my daily routine, allocating more time for physical activity. I discovered that regular exercise had a profound effect on my mood, helping me to forget about life’s troubles and feel energized（有活力的）, rejuvenated（恢复活力的）, and joyful.

If you find yourself in a similar funk（恐惧，怯懦）, I encourage you to confide（限制） in someone you trust and ask for help. Additionally, consider integrating（整合） regular exercise into your life. It can be immensely helpful for your mental well-being.
