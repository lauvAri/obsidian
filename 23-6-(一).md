Today there is a growing number of awareness that mental well-being needs to be given as much attention as physical health. As is known to all, only when we are in a good state of mental health, can we achieve our goals. There are numerous cases in which people suffered so much from something negative in their life,  and therefore making them feel grim about life and cannot find the meaning of it.
I used to feel low in my mind for a long period when I always mess up with all the stuff so that I thought I was completely a loser. I was stuck in a bad mood, with the deep feeling of loneliness, helplessness and unconfident. Finally, I was aware that I must do something to change the state. So I talked all my awful feelings to my parents and got their warm supports, which helped me extremely a lot. In addition, I  decided to change my personal schedule to set aside more time to do sports because I found doing exercise regularly really made forget all the bad things in my life and feel energetic, refreshed and happy.
So if you are in a bad mood, try to talk with someone who you trust most and seek help. Also, you can adjust your life arrangement to do sports regularly, which can be quite  beneficial  to your mental well-being.
